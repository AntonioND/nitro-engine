Nitro Engine v0.7.0
===================

Introduction
------------

This is a 3D game engine, a lot of functions designed to simplify the process of
making a 3D game. It isn't standalone, it needs libnds to work. However, if you
are developing for the NDS it is likely that you already have it installed. If
not, you need to install devkitARM and libnds.

Setup
-----

1. Copy this folder (or create a symbolic link) to
   ``<path/to/devkitpro>/nitro-engine`` so that the Makefiles can find the
   library.

2. Go to that folder and run ``make``. This should build the library. If
   everything goes right, you're ready to go.

3. If you want to check that everything is working as expected, open one of the
   folders of the examples and type ``make``. That should build an ``.nds`` file
   that you can run on an emulator or real hardware. Note that some features of
   the 3D hardware aren't emulated by most emulators, so you may need to use an
   actual NDS to test some things.

4. By default, Nitro Engine is compiled with debug options enabled. Go to
   ``NEMain.h`` and comment the line ``#define NE_DEBUG`` to disable them and
   save CPU usage and memory. You'll need to recompile the library for the new
   value to take effect.
