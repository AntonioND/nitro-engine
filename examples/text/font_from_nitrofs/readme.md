# Rich text font from NitroFS

This example shows how to load BMFont fonts from Nitro FS. Check the official
[website](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) to see how to generate
them. Remember that the output format must be binary for the font metadata, and
PNG for the images.

The build system used is [ArchitectDS](https://github.com/AntonioND/architectds)
because of the flexibility it gives the user.

In order to build this example, run:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

To clean the build results, run:

```bash
python3 build.py --clean
```
