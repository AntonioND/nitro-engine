The depth bitmap is a bit complicated... It is quite difficult to regulate the depth...

The color you have to use to set the depth is blue. Clear bitmap is in its farthest point if blue == 255.

If you want to hide everything including the 2D projection, use red.



If someone has a better idea, tell me.
