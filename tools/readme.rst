Nitro Engine Tools
==================

The following tools are used to export models created on the PC to the NDS:

- **Nitro_Texture_Converter**

  It converts any PNG into any DS texture format (except compressed format).
  It uses the alpha channel (if any) for texture transparency.

- **obj2dl**

  Converts a Wavefront OBJ file into a NDS display list.

- **md5_to_dsma**

  Converts MD5 models with skeletal animation (md5mesh and md5anim files) into a
  format that allows them to be displayed on the NDS efficiently.

- **img2ds** (WIP)

  Converts images in several formats to NDS textures and palettes. It is
  recommended to use PNG files with transparency.
