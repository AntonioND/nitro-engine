Those tools are used to export models created on the PC to the NDS:


-Those were made by me:

Windows:
 |
 |-Nitro_Texture_Converter:
 |   Converts any PNG into any DS texture format (except compressed format).
 |   Uses the alpha channel (if any) for texture transparency.
 |-MD2_2_BIN:
 |   Exports the first frame of an MD2 model to a NDS display list.
 |   This is more optimized than NDS_Model_Exporter.
 +-MD2_2_NEA:
     Exports every frame of an MD2 model to a NEA file that can be used 
     by Nitro Engine.

-Others:

Windows:
 |
 +-NDS_Model_Exporter:
     Exports models in some formats to NDS display lists. It can export
     textures too, but only to RGB format.
